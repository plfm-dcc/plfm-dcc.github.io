## About

The {{< var group.name >}} group at [DCC-FCUP](https://www.dcc.fc.up.pt/) is composed of faculty and students who are interested in improving the reliability of computing systems.
Research interests include:

- Programming language design and implementation
- Logic
- Formal verification
- Functional programming

We aim to provide an active and inclusive research environment and plan to run frequent events to encourage discussion between students, researchers, and faculty interested in computing science and applications.
<!-- If you are interested in learning more, come to one of our [meetings](pages/events.qmd), or get in [touch](#contact).-->
