# Programming Languages & Formal Methods @ DCC-FCUP

:::  -->

::: {#about-lab}

We are a research group on [TOPIC] at [DCC-FCUP](https://www.dcc.fc.up.pt/).
Our aim is to [GOALS].
Our research interests include:

- Software verification and theorem proving
- Program testing and analysis
- Programming languages and type systems
- Program logics and semantics

We aim to provide an active and inclusive research environment that includes [ACTIVITIES].
If you are interested in learning more<!--  about the group and our research -->, come to one of our [meetings](events.qmd), or get in [touch](#contact).
